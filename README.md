## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to get values from input tags, do simple validation and this trick with the Date where it automatically calculates if a date is valid! This is a really good challenge. I also got to know requestAnimationFrame() method that allows smooth animations.

### Continued development

Doing this project allowed me to determine aspects that i want to improve like studying animations. i only know animation with css and this project made me realize that i can use js in that aspect too ðŸ˜Š. I also want to improve my js knowledge, and web layout stuffs like grid and flex.

### Useful resources

(Sorry, i just used google in general)
